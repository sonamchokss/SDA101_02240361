## Learned:

1. HTML Form Structure: I created a form with various input fields, including text boxes for details like "Full Name", "Student No.", "Course/Programme", etc. I have understood the basics of creating an HTML form, using input tags and organizing them in a structured manner.

2. Form Styling with CSS: I have applied basic styling to make my form look appealing. This includes setting a layout with flexbox (display: flex), centering the form (justify-content, align-items), and using gradients (linear-gradient) for a visually attractive background and button.


3. Container and Button Design: I have used a container (div.container) to hold the form and applied padding, background color, and border-radius to style it. For buttons, I've implemented hover effects to change the background gradient direction.


4. Responsive and Clean Layout: I've used flex properties and width percentages to make the form layout flexible. Even wrapped the input fields inside .user-details and set a width of 50%, ensuring the form adjusts to different screen sizes while maintaining its structure.



## Challenges and Solutions:

Input Validation (Syntax Errors):

Issue: I have sometimes misspelled words in multiple input fields.

Solution: Fix the spelling to ensure the form validates correctly.
