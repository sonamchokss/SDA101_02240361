## What I have learned

1. HTML Structure:

I have created a basic web page structure using HTML, which includes defining the document type, adding metadata, and linking a CSS file. Likewise, I structured a table that organizes academic records with clear labels and a well-organized format.


2. Semantic HTML:

I've used semantic elements like <thead> and <tbody> to separate the header and body of the table, making the code more readable and accessible.


3. Commenting and Documentation:

Added comments in the code to help in understanding its structure and functionality, making it easier to maintain or modify in the future.


4. Table Design:

Tables are a great way to display structured data like academic records, and Iâ€™ve learned how to organize data in rows and columns.


5. CSS Integration:

Linking an external CSS file to style the table and other elements ensures a clean separation of content and design.



## Challenges Faced and How I Overcame Them:

1. Code Organization and Readability:

Challenge: Initially, the code was readable but could have benefitted from better structure and clarity.

Solution: used comments to label different sections of the code, making it easier to follow and understand the purpose of each part.


2. Table Semantics:

Challenge: Structuring the table without <thead> and <tbody> would have reduced accessibility and clarity.

Solution: used semantic tags to differentiate between the table header and body, making the table easier to read and more accessible for screen readers.


3. CSS Styling:

Challenge: Styling a table can sometimes be tricky when aligning text, adding borders, or making it responsive for different screen sizes.

Solution: By linking a CSS file (GradeRecord.css), ensured that all styling can be handled externally, and we can later refine it to ensure the table looks clean and professional.


4. Data Display and Alignment:

Challenge: Displaying the data in a neat format that aligns the marks, percentages, and grades correctly.

Solution: By using the table structure with appropriate headings, ensured that the data is well organized in rows and columns.
